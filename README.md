Saiyairak 2D combines the immediacy of a multiplayer game with the practical tools of a virtual workspace. Users create or join shared pixel-art spaces, move through collision-aware maps, chat in realtime, customize their characters, study with persistent timers and leaderboards, share a synchronized whiteboard, and use LiveKit-powered audio, video, screen sharing, and TURN fallback. The application is a TypeScript monorepo with an authoritative WebSocket game server, an Express control plane, PostgreSQL persistence, and a fully self-hosted Docker deployment.

## Live demo

The production deployment is available at **[metaverse.nemportfolio.in](https://metaverse.nemportfolio.in)**.

Create an account, choose an official map or create a room, and share its six-character join code with another user. Camera and microphone access are optional and are only requested in video-enabled spaces.

## Key features

- **Realtime shared worlds** — low-latency WebSocket presence, grid movement, join/leave events, and collision-aware positioning.
- **Five purpose-built maps** — Study Library, Multi-room House, Virtual Office, Classroom, and Enchanted Forest Hide & Seek.
- **Authoritative Hide & Seek** — server-owned roles, timers, tagging, line of sight, concealment zones, spectator states, and visibility filtering for 3–12 players.
- **Woka character customization** — composable character appearance stored per user and synchronized across clients.
- **Room creation and quick join** — create spaces from templates and invite people with short, human-friendly room codes.
- **Realtime chat** — room-scoped messaging with trimming, length limits, and per-user rate limiting.
- **Audio and video rooms** — LiveKit SFU media with camera/microphone controls and participant video docks.
- **Presentation mode** — proximity-aware lectern permissions, screen sharing, and a focused viewer experience.
- **Synchronized classroom whiteboard** — creator-controlled Excalidraw scenes broadcast to everyone in the room, with server-side permission and payload checks.
- **Study sessions and leaderboards** — persistent timers with daily, weekly, monthly, and all-time rankings.
- **Responsive controls** — keyboard movement on desktop plus a pointer-friendly virtual joystick and zoom controls on touch devices.
- **Self-hosted operations** — frontend, APIs, realtime server, PostgreSQL, LiveKit, Redis, TLS, and TURN can all run on one VPS.

## Repository structure

Saiyairak 2D is a Bun workspace monorepo. Product code lives under `metaverse/`, cross-service integration tests are kept at the repository root, and deployment infrastructure is separated from application code.

## Architecture overview and diagram

<img width="1672" height="941" alt="metaverse" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd694938-a144-49ef-9698-0c63ab3ce110" />

The system is deliberately split into an **application plane** and a **media plane**. The application plane owns identity, room metadata, study data, movement, chat, whiteboards, and game rules. The media plane owns high-bandwidth WebRTC audio, video, and screen sharing. In production both planes run on the same VPS, but the boundary allows LiveKit or PostgreSQL to move to dedicated infrastructure later.

### Where to make common changes

| Change                             | Primary location                                      | Usually also check                                                |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Page, modal, HUD, or responsive UI | `metaverse/apps/web/src/components` and `pages`       | `styles.css`, relevant hooks, production bundle size              |
| Player rendering or movement feel  | `web/src/game/entities`, `scenes`, and `systems`      | Shared WS messages and server collision validation                |
| API endpoint or authentication     | `metaverse/apps/http/routes/v1`                       | Zod schemas, middleware, Prisma, and integration tests            |
| Presence, chat, or game rules      | `metaverse/apps/ws`                                   | `packages/types`, web connection hooks, and Bun tests             |
| Shared protocol shape              | `metaverse/packages/types`                            | Every sender, receiver, and protocol-focused test                 |
| Database model                     | `metaverse/packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma`          | New migration, seed behavior, API queries, and deployment startup |
| Map geometry or gameplay           | `web/public/assets/spaces/<map>`                      | Collision connectivity, spawn points, server config tests         |
| Video, screen share, or TURN       | Web media hooks plus `deploy/livekit`                 | HTTP token permissions, firewall ports, integration tests         |
| Docker or public routing           | Root Compose files, `metaverse/docker`, and `deploy/` | `.env.example`, health checks, README, rollback procedure         |

The frontend and WebSocket server intentionally share protocol types but not authority: the browser renders and requests actions, while the server validates and decides the resulting shared state.

## Engineering scorecard

## Technical highlights

- **Authoritative realtime rules:** the server validates JWTs, room membership, one-tile movement, map bounds, collision, Hide & Seek phase rules, visibility, and tags before broadcasting state.
- **Privacy-aware Hide & Seek:** concealed hider coordinates are withheld, visibility is calculated per viewer, and line-of-sight checks stop at collision tiles.
- **Typed protocol boundary:** shared TypeScript message contracts keep the React client and WebSocket server aligned.
- **Same-origin application gateway:** Nginx serves the SPA, forwards `/api/*` to Express, and upgrades `/socket` to the WebSocket service, avoiding browser CORS complexity.
- **Independent media plane:** LiveKit carries audio, video, and screen-share media while application presence and gameplay remain on the WebSocket server.
- **Defensive realtime inputs:** malformed frames are ignored, chat is rate-limited, whiteboard updates have element and byte limits, and metadata lookups are capped and batched.
- **Self-healing presence:** a ping/pong heartbeat reaps connections that die without a close frame, a join that finishes after its socket closed is discarded instead of inserted, and opening a space a second time replaces the previous session rather than duplicating the avatar.
- **Hardened credential handling:** signup enforces a length, commonness, and username-similarity policy; signin returns a single uniform failure so unknown usernames and wrong passwords are indistinguishable; scrypt comparison is constant-time and tolerates malformed stored hashes; tokens carry no role claim; and failed attempts are rate-limited per IP.
- **Collision as data:** each map ships an explicit grid, allowing the client and server to apply the same movement boundaries.
- **Reproducible containers:** one multi-stage Dockerfile produces separate HTTP, WebSocket, and Nginx images from the same frozen Bun lockfile.
- **Safe startup order:** Compose waits for PostgreSQL, applies Prisma migrations, performs idempotent seeding, checks HTTP health, and only then starts the public web gateway.
- **Production operability:** container health checks, bounded local logs, persistent database storage, a PostgreSQL backup script, and TURN fallback are included.

## Prerequisites

The complete Docker workflow is the easiest way to run the project.

- **Git**
- **Docker Engine** with the **Docker Compose v2** plugin
- **GNU Make** for the documented shortcuts
- **Bun 1.2+** for host development; the current environment and production image use Bun 1.3.14
- **Node.js 18+ and pnpm** only when running the separate Jest integration suite
- A Linux host is recommended for the local LiveKit configuration because it uses host networking

Make sure these ports are available for the complete local stack:

|        Port | Protocol | Local purpose                               |
| ----------: | -------- | ------------------------------------------- |
|        5173 | TCP      | Public Nginx/Vite web entrypoint            |
|        3000 | TCP      | HTTP API                                    |
|        3001 | TCP      | Application WebSocket server                |
|        5433 | TCP      | PostgreSQL exposed by the full Docker stack |
|   7880–7881 | TCP      | LiveKit signaling and ICE/TCP fallback      |
|        3478 | UDP      | Local TURN                                  |
| 50000–60000 | UDP      | LiveKit WebRTC media                        |

## Local development setup

### Option A: complete Docker stack

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chandekriangkrai-cmyk/Saiyairak-2D.git
cd Saiyairak-2D
cp .env.example .env
```

Replace the development secrets in `.env`, then validate and start everything:

```bash
make docker-config
make docker-up
```

Open **http://localhost:5173**. Database migration and seed jobs run automatically before the application services start.

```bash
make docker-logs  # follow all service logs
make docker-down  # stop services and preserve PostgreSQL data
```

### Option B: host processes with Vite hot reload

Stop the complete Compose stack first if it is running, then install dependencies and prepare PostgreSQL:

```bash
make docker-down
make setup
docker compose -f metaverse/livekit/docker-compose.yml up -d
make run
```

This runs Express on port 3000, the WebSocket server on 3001, and Vite on 5173. `make run` keeps all three foreground processes together so `Ctrl+C` stops them as a group.

## Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` for local Docker development. Production secrets belong in `/opt/saiyairak2d/.env.production` and must never be committed.

A suitable local `.env` starts with:

```dotenv
POSTGRES_DB=saiyairak2d
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=replace-with-a-random-local-password
POSTGRES_PORT=5433

JWT_PASSWORD=replace-with-a-long-random-secret
AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_MAX=10

LIVEKIT_API_KEY=devkey
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=replace-with-at-least-32-random-characters
LIVEKIT_PUBLIC_URL=ws://localhost:7880

HTTP_PORT=3000
WS_PORT=3001
WEB_PORT=5173
```

Generate secrets with a password manager or, on Linux/macOS, `openssl rand -hex 32`.

## Docker setup

The root `compose.yaml` defines a complete local environment:

| Service   | Lifecycle    | Role                                                                 |
| --------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `db`      | Long-running | PostgreSQL with a named persistent volume                            |
| `migrate` | One-shot     | Applies committed Prisma migrations after PostgreSQL becomes healthy |
| `seed`    | One-shot     | Idempotently inserts maps, avatars, and the official space           |
| `livekit` | Long-running | Local LiveKit SFU and TURN service                                   |
| `http`    | Long-running | Express API, authentication, data, and LiveKit tokens                |
| `ws`      | Long-running | Application realtime server and game authority                       |
| `web`     | Long-running | Nginx static frontend and same-origin reverse proxy                  |

Common lifecycle commands:

```bash
docker compose config --quiet
docker compose up --build -d
docker compose ps -a
docker compose logs -f
docker compose down
```

To intentionally erase the local database and start clean:

```bash
make docker-reset
```

> `docker-reset` deletes the PostgreSQL volume. `docker-down` does not.

The multi-stage `metaverse/Dockerfile` shares the frozen Bun dependency layer, generates the Prisma client once, and emits separate `http`, `ws`, and `web` targets.

## Testing

### Bun unit and regression suite

```bash
cd metaverse
bun test
bun test --coverage
```

Current result: **82 passing, 0 failing**, with **88.17% line coverage and 89.34% function coverage** across the seventeen modules loaded by this suite.

The fast suite covers:

- Hide & Seek configuration and asset alignment
- Spawn and river-crossing connectivity
- Collision-aware line of sight
- Authoritative round roles, phases, tags, concealment, and disconnects
- Non-empty player labels when user metadata arrives late
- JWT request authentication: expired tokens, tampered payloads and signatures, foreign signing secrets, and algorithms outside the allowlist
- Rate-limiter behavior, including `skipSuccessfulRequests` and the auth-limit override parser
- Connection liveness: ping/pong sweeps, termination of unresponsive sockets, and the heartbeat interval override parser
- Room roster eviction when the same account opens a second connection to the same space
- Log redaction of credentials, level resolution, and the `LOG_LEVEL` override parser
- Request correlation: inbound id validation, rejection of ids that could corrupt a log line, and route templating
- Error classification across `AppError`, Zod, body-parser failures, and unknown throwables, including the guarantee that internal messages never reach the client
- Shutdown sequencing: step ordering, crash exit codes, per-step timeouts, and repeated signals

### Jest cross-service integration suite

Start the complete local stack first, then run:

```bash
AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_MAX=100000 make docker-up
cd tests
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm test -- --runInBand
```

`AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_MAX` matters here.
The suite deliberately drives failed signin and signup attempts, and `authLimiter` counts only failed requests over a fifteen-minute window.
At the production default of `10` the counter survives the end of a run, so a second run inside the same window is throttled and roughly forty scenarios fail at once on a `429` from `signup`.
Raising the override for local runs keeps the suite deterministic without weakening the shipped default.

Current result: **63 passing, 0 failing, 63 total** across 10 suites, stable across repeated back-to-back runs. Authentication, catalog, rooms, metadata, chat, study, LiveKit, WebSocket authentication and leave, room roster lifecycle, and malformed-frame scenarios pass. Four obsolete movement scenarios that targeted coordinates in the former `space-joined.users` shape have been removed; equivalent cross-service movement coverage should eventually be rewritten against `visibleUsers` and the current visibility protocol.

Coverage shown in this README comes from Bun's instrumented fast suite. Jest integration coverage is not currently collected, so combining it into the coverage percentage would be misleading.

## Saiyairak 2D deployment

The repository now includes a self-contained Render Blueprint for the Saiyairak 2D build. It deploys the web frontend, HTTP API/authentication, WebSocket realtime server, and PostgreSQL on one public web service so `/api` and `/socket` stay on the same origin. The English Learning App remains a static asset and is not rebuilt or modified by the deployment layer.

[![Deploy Saiyairak 2D to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/chandekriangkrai-cmyk/Saiyairak-2D)

The free Render configuration is intended for testing/preview: free web services can spin down after inactivity, and free Render Postgres expires after 30 days. Upgrade the database before using the service as a durable production save system.

## Upstream reference deployment architecture

The following section documents the upstream Saiyairak 2D deployment model inherited by this foundation. It is reference infrastructure, not a claim that this Saiyairak 2D fork is already running on that VPS. The frontend and PostgreSQL database are on the same server as the APIs; Vercel and Neon are not involved.

### Public routing

| Public endpoint                     | Caddy destination               | Purpose                      |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `https://metaverse.nemportfolio.in` | Nginx on `127.0.0.1:5173`       | SPA, `/api/*`, and `/socket` |
| `wss://rtc.nemportfolio.in`         | LiveKit on `127.0.0.1:7880`     | Media signaling              |
| `turn.nemportfolio.in`              | LiveKit TURN on ports 3478/5349 | UDP and TLS relay fallback   |

Cloudflare provides DNS. Caddy obtains certificates and routes TLS by SNI. LiveKit media additionally uses UDP ranges 30000–40000 for relayed traffic and 50000–60000 for direct WebRTC media.

Caddy proxies the application at layer 4, so it cannot add `X-Forwarded-For` and every request would otherwise reach Express with the same gateway address.
It therefore speaks PROXY protocol v2 to Nginx, which listens for it on port 8081 and recovers the original address through `real_ip_header proxy_protocol`.
Port 8080 stays plain HTTP for local Compose and the container health check.
Rate limiting depends on this: without it a single client's failed logins would exhaust the shared `authLimiter` budget and lock out every user.

### Runtime layout

- `/opt/saiyairak2d` contains application source, Compose files, deployment configuration, and `.env.production`.
- `compose.production.yaml` runs PostgreSQL, migration, seed, HTTP, WebSocket, and Nginx services.
- `deploy/livekit/compose.yaml` runs Caddy, LiveKit, and Redis with host networking.
- Only Nginx is exposed from the application Compose network, and only on loopback; Caddy is the public TLS entrypoint.
- PostgreSQL persists in the `postgres-data` Docker volume.
- Container logs rotate at 10 MB with five retained files per service.
- `deploy/backup-postgres.sh` creates compressed `pg_dump` backups and removes local backups older than seven days.

### Rebuild and redeploy

After delivering updated source to `/opt/saiyairak2d`, rebuild first and then recreate the affected containers:

```bash
cd /opt/saiyairak2d

docker compose \
  --env-file .env.production \
  -f compose.production.yaml \
  build

docker compose \
  --env-file .env.production \
  -f compose.production.yaml \
  up -d
```

Verify the deployment:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.production -f compose.production.yaml ps -a
docker compose --env-file .env.production -f compose.production.yaml logs --tail=100 http ws web
curl -fsS https://metaverse.nemportfolio.in/healthz
```

`migrate` and `seed` ending in `Exited (0)` is expected: they are successful one-shot jobs.

### Scaling path

1. Load-test WebSocket gameplay and LiveKit media separately, then together, to establish real CPU, memory, bandwidth, and latency limits.
2. Move PostgreSQL backups off-host and move PostgreSQL to a dedicated or managed server when database contention becomes visible.
3. Make room and whiteboard state external or partition rooms with sticky routing before adding WebSocket replicas.
4. Replicate the stateless HTTP service behind the gateway.
5. Add LiveKit nodes using Redis-backed coordination when media bandwidth, not application traffic, becomes the bottleneck.

for local setup, architectural rules, testing expectations, and the pull-request process.

## Known limitations

- **No certified global concurrency figure:** the 8 GB production VPS has not undergone a combined WebSocket, WebRTC, and TURN load test. Hide & Seek is intentionally capped at 12 players per room; other rooms do not yet enforce a hard participant cap.
- **Single WebSocket authority:** room, whiteboard, and active game state are held in one process. Restarting it clears ephemeral state, and horizontal replicas would diverge without shared state or deterministic room routing.
- **Disconnect detection is not instant:** a connection that dies without a close frame is only removed once it misses a heartbeat, so a departure can take up to two `WS_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MS` periods to broadcast. Rejoining the same space evicts the stale session immediately.
- **Single-server failure domain:** the app, PostgreSQL, Redis, LiveKit, and local backups currently share one VPS. A host failure can affect every layer; backups should also be copied offsite.
- **Movement integration coverage gap:** four obsolete scenarios were removed, leaving 63 of 63 integration scenarios green. Valid/rejected movement and collision bounds should be reintroduced using the current split between presence identities and `visibleUsers` coordinates.
- **Large collaboration chunks:** the initial shell is compact, but the Excalidraw/diagram dependency graph produces a 741.39 kB gzip shared lazy chunk. More granular whiteboard code splitting would improve first-open latency on slow devices.
- **JWT storage:** seven-day bearer tokens are stored in browser `localStorage`. Moving to secure, `HttpOnly`, same-site cookies would reduce token exposure during a successful XSS attack.
- **Local LiveKit favors Linux:** the development configuration uses host networking and is less portable to Docker environments without equivalent host-network support.
- **No automated CI gate is committed yet:** tests, type checks, builds, and deployment verification are currently operator-run rather than enforced on every pull request.
